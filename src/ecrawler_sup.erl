%% When the top-level supervisor is asked to terminate, it calls exit(ChildPid, shutdown) on each
%% of the pids. If the child is a worker and trapping exits, it will call its own
%% terminate function; otherwise, itâ€™s just going to die. When a supervisor gets the
%% shutdown signal, it will forward that signal to its own children in the same way.

%% If the gen_server is part of a supervision tree and is ordered by its supervisor to terminate, this function will 
%% be called with Reason=shutdown if the following conditions apply: 
%% * the gen_server has been set to trap exit signals, and 
%% * the shutdown strategy as defined in the supervisor's child specification is an integer timeout value, not brutal_kill.
